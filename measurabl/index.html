  </header>

  <div class="post-content">
    <p>I first heard about Measurabl at La Jolla Country Day, where a former classmate of mine in Linear Algebra, Stephen Clark, interned at Measurabl.</p>

<p>I’m currently in the process of deciding between Vanderbilt Engineering and Georgetown SFS. Before going off to college, I wish to contribute to a company that can provide me valuable coding experience - but more importantly, to develop teamwork skills in a startup environment.</p>

<p>For the past two years, I performed as a violinist with Shen Yun, getting to travel around the world, imparting classical Chinese culture and, in every place, learning about what makes other cultures unique.</p>

<p>In a professional orchestra, the most important soft skills, I believe, are staying alert, coordinating with others, taking subtle cues and improvising. Travelling and performing shows demand, in the long run and at the moment of the performance, being flexible when the situation demands it. I hope to bring those skills wherever I go.</p>

<p>I’ve been learning Data Structures and Algorithms and practicing coding in Python. I’m also studying statistical methods in an effort to do data analysis on political economy. Two subjects that are of particular interest to me: quantitative research into political decision-making and polling methodology.</p>

<h3 id="so-why-measurabl-why-me">So why Measurabl? (Why me?)</h3>

<p>Everything I do, I resolve to do well. In a QA role, I’ll be eager to learn, communicate, and make sure testing is carried out well. After some experience with the intricacies of my role, I’ll strive to develop a solid background in writing scripts to automate and complement testing.</p>

<p>I’m ready to master anything that’s required. To me, Measurabl’s business plan has limitless potential. Water bottle caps didn’t become smaller because of government mandates; they became smaller because it was financially viable. Accurate data collection for companies allows them to innovate and is something I want to be a part of. I believe an internship with Measurabl is the right place for me to start.</p>

<p>Thanks for considering me!</p>
