  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Hi! My name is Jerod and I’m a student at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service majoring in Science, Technology and International Affairs.</p>

<p>I’m excited to apply for this internship with Robinhood to immerse myself in the fields of software development and finance, but more importantly, to learn and grow with a passionate team.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m a data science intern at the <a href="http://cset.georgetown.edu">Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET)</a>. Currently, I’ve completed a project on fuzzy address matching and and working on insights from institutional data from ArXiv, .designing a workflow to fuzzy match addresses whenever a potential partner provided a list of buildings,</p>

<p>More projects over this school year.</p>

<p>Last summer, I interned in data science at Measurabl, a SaaS company that helps companies aggregate, report and act on sustainability data. Measurabl’s clients include national REITs and S&amp;P Global. In my role, I researched the feasibility of using ML to include waste usage data aggregated from clients into Measurabl’s unique building scoring system. I presented a draft on implementing waste scoring with Gradient Boosting. Working with representatives of the industry led me to explore opportunities in finance.</p>

<p>Some other projects at Measurabl include automating tasks from the devops team to help migrate our science workflow to Docker and AWS. Through that, I gained valuable experience debugging data pipelines and implementing hotfixes.</p>

        *I can do some frontend programming.
    </center>
<br /></p>

<p>I enjoy looking for patterns. From AIME problems to <a href="https://janestreet.com/puzzles/current-puzzle/">Jane Street puzzles</a>, I like to put mathematics, especially statistical modelling, into practice. As the head coach of my school’s Middle School Mathcounts team, I led weekly drills on various topics to prepare for Mathcounts and Math Field Day, where we had a blast.</p>

<p>Diligent investing combines three skills valuable everywhere: a fundamental understanding of human nature, raw brainpower, and self-control. For policymakers to understand the broader dynamics of the economy, they must have exposure to the field. A healthy financial industry expands the pool of resources for all and provides for prosperity at home and abroad.</p>

<p>Work with a team that’s passionate about expanding these opportunities to all.</p>

<p>I’m fluent with Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. Currently, I’m interested in statistical methods of analysis on political economy. One area of particular interest to me is quantitative research into political decision-making. Ultimately, I want to work in a niche of public policy to promote human rights abroad.</p>

<p>Everything I do, I resolve to do well. Here at Robinhood, I’ll be eager to learn, communicate, and make sure my work is carried out well.</p>

<p>A solid understanding of the current state of computing - the benefits and consequences of innovation, domestically and internationally - informs decision makers on how to move forward with policy in this era to advance American interests domestically and abroad. Here at Georgetown, I believe an internship with CSET is the right place for me to start.</p>

<p>I have sample projects on Github, including a short exploration on the <a href="https://github.com/Jerodsun/notebooks/blob/master/Education%20of%20Federal%20Judges.ipynb">Education of Federal Judges</a>.</p>

<p>I’d be happy to talk about my implementation of <code>scikit-learn</code>, although the source code is company property. I am also eager to dive into <code>Tensorflow</code> and <code>Keras</code> at my time here.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I’m working on implementing financial models and calculations in a full stack app.</p>

<p><a href="https://rwalk-backend-stage.herokuapp.com/swagger/">random-walk-backend</a> is one of the backend APIs I’ve been developing.
<a href="https://github.com/Jerodsun/random-walk-backend">This is the develop branch</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://rwalk-backend-stage.herokuapp.com/api/blackscholes/">POST some sample data into Black-Scholes-Merton Call Pricing</a> and watch the magic happen!</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is on a free Heroku dyno, so please allow 20-30 seconds for it to boot.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="https://tradenotebook-alpha.herokuapp.com/swagger/">Zero Intelligence Agent-Based Model</a> is in the works.</p>

<p>Everything I do, I resolve to do well. At the Investment Office, I’ll be eager to learn, communicate, and make sure my work is carried out well. I have experience with selenium for automation and enjoy applications of Python for automating tasks. Here at Georgetown, I believe an internship with the Investment Office is the right place to start.</p>

<p>Last month, I implemented calcuations of Black-Scholes-Merton and Brownian Motion into an API. <a href="https://rwalk-backend-stage.herokuapp.com/api/blackscholes/">POST some sample data into Black-Scholes-Merton Call Pricing</a> and watch the magic happen!</p>

<p>Thanks for considering me!</p>
