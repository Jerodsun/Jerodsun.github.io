    <p>Hi! My name is Jerod! I’m born and raised here in San Diego where Collins Aerospace has an office. I am currently a junior at Georgetown University studying Economics,  Computer Science, Mathematics. After I graduate, I hope to pursue a role at the intersection of all of these, and I think this is a valuable skillset that I can bring anywhere I go.</p>

<p>I enjoy looking for patterns. From running regressions and conducting data wrangling in python to building pipelines with Airflow, I like to put mathematics into practice. I’m currently a data science intern at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging technology during the school year, where I’ve worked on a variety of visualization and software engineering tasks. My current task is collecting and building a RoBERTa model on millions of business descriptions to predict industrial classifications.</p>

<p>Previously, I interned at Measurabl, a Software as a Service company that helps companies aggregate, report and act on sustainability data, where I worked on the proprietary building scoring system with scikit-learn, created visualizations of building property types for the sales team, and worked on the data science pipeline.</p>

<p>I also interned at 0ptimus Analytics, where I worked on backend and data science tasks and their predictive analytics for modelling the 2020 election, where we had one of the most accurate predictions.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like to work on projects related to agent based modelling, and currently am writing a thesis project analyzing voting patterns in my home state.</p>

<p>I would love an opportunity to be considered for a Data Science role this summer to immerse myself into software and data engineering, but more importantly, to learn and grow with a passionate team. I’m a fast learner and willing to adapt, being flexible when the situation demands it.</p>

<p>I am committed to working and growing with a passionate team, and making sure my work is carried out in quality. However, sometimes, trade offs need to be made. At 0ptimus Analytics, a political data science firm I’ve worked for in the past, I’ve been in customer-facing roles where we explained our methodology and the steps that we needed to take to make sure our work was up to the customer’s standards. However, the client required that the data be conducted by a deadline that we thought was difficult to meet. Because this was an important client, we decided that we needed to make things work out in the end, which resulted in making trade offs with regard to my personal time management, prioritizing different tasks, and communicating with other people on the team that we had in order to make this deadline. Through this, I learned that sometimes, one has to push oneself in order to make things work, while keeping in touch with others on the team. Through this experience, our team actually bonded together much better. And of course, this experience helped us make sure that in the future, if another team had a similar time crunch and needed resources or a quick update on what could be pushed back, that our team we would also be flexible in making things work. Through this, we made sure every stakeholder from the client to everyone else on the team were able to meet our standards and learn and grow in the process. Here at Collins Aerospace, I’ll always be eager to learn, communicate, and always keep an open mind to make sure work is carried out well.</p>

<p>My Data Structures and Algorithms educational background is mostly in C++. For full stack software engineering, I have some limited frontend javascript development knowledge with Angular. On the backend, I’ve worked on projects with Ruby on Rails and Java with Spring Boot when a corresponding change was made to the data science pipeline. Most of my previous software engineering and data science experience is Python-based - Django and Django REST framework, Airflow, Celery, and of course, matplotlib and various other aspects included in the anaconda distribution. Most of the data science projects I currently do with machine learning is conducted using scikit-learn or keras. I’m comfortable with writing SQL queries and managing MySQL. I’ve worked extensively with Google Cloud, specifically, BigQuery both for production and research. I’ve also written comprehensive unit tests and used Selenium for automation testing.</p>

<p>Lastly, I’ve done Economics research using Refinitiv’s EIKON terminal, which is similar to a bloomberg terminal.</p>

<p>Thanks for considering me!</p>
