first consul: [ . . . ] England fears us and the continental powers do not like us. 
Given this, how can we hope for a strong peace! Besides, do you think that a
peace lasting five years or more suits the form and circumstances of our
government?
<br />
state counsellor: I think this break would suit France very well after ten
years of war.
<br />
first consul: You misunderstand me: I am not questioning whether a
genuine, robust peace is good for a well-established state; I am asking
whether ours is sufficiently such as not to still have need of victories.
<br />
state counsellor: I haven’t thought enough about such a serious question
to answer categorically: all I can say, or rather what I feel, is that a state
which can only be consolidated through war is in a very unfortunate
situation.
<br />
first consul: <light-highlight>The greatest misfortune would be to misjudge its situation,
because one can cater for it when one knows it.</light-highlight> Now, tell me: do you
believe in the continuing hostility of these governments that have nevertheless just signed the peace?
<br />
state counsellor: It would be very difficult for me not to believe in it.
<br />
first consul: So then, draw the conclusion! If these governments always
have war at heart, if they are bound to renew it one day, it would be better
for it to be sooner than later. For every day weakens the impression in them
of their last defeats and tends to diminish among us the prestige of our last
victories. All the advantage therefore lies with them.
<br />
state counsellor: But, citizen consul, do you discount the advantage you
can take of peace to organize the interior?
<br />
first consul: I was going to come to that. Certainly, that major consideration has not escaped my mind and, even in the midst of war, I have
demonstrated that I do not neglect what concerns institutions and good
order at home. I will not stop there; there is still a lot to be done. But aren’t
military successes more necessary to dazzle and contain the interior?
Remember that a First Consul does not resemble those kings by the grace
of God who regard their states as an heirloom. Their power has old habits
for auxiliaries. Among us, by contrast, such old habits are obstacles. Today’s
French government resembles nothing surrounding it. Hated by its
neighbours, compelled to contain in the interior several classes of malcontents, to impress so many enemies it requires dramatic gestures and, consequently, war.
<br />
state counsellor: Citizen consul, I admit that you have much more to do to
consolidate your government than do the neighbouring kings to maintain
theirs. On the one hand, however, Europe is not unaware that you are
capable of conquering and, in order to remember it, does not need you to
supply new proof every year; and on the other, peacetime activities are not
always low key and you can command admiration by great works.
<br />
first consul: <light-highlight>Regarded from a distance, old victories have scarcely any
impact and great works of art do not make a great impression except on
those who see them</light-highlight>; and that is a small number of people. My intention is
indeed to multiply such works; the future will perhaps be more attached to
me for them than for my victories. But for the present there is nothing that
can resonate as much as military success: that is what I think; it is an unhappy
situation. To consolidate itself, a new government like ours must, I repeat,
dazzle and astound.
<br />
state counsellor: Your government, citizen consul, is not, it seems to me,
completely new-born. It has assumed a manly garb since Marengo: ruled by
someone strong-minded, and supported by the arms of thirty million
inhabitants, it occupies a rather distinguished place among the governments
of Europe.
<br />
first consul: So, my dear friend, you think that suffices? One must come first
of all or succumb.
<br />
state counsellor: And to obtain that result, you see nothing but war?
<br />
first consul: Yes, citizen . . . I shall tolerate peace if our neighbours can keep
it. But if they force me to take up arms again before they are blunted by
softness or prolonged inaction, I shall view that as an advantage.
<br />
state counsellor: Citizen consul, what duration do you assign to this state
of anxiety which, in the very midst of peace, causes war to be missed?
<br />
first consul: My dear friend, I am not sufficiently informed about the future
to answer that question. But I feel that to hope for more robustness and good
faith in peace treaties, either the form of the governments around us must
approximate to ours, or our political institutions must be rather more in
harmony with theirs. There is always a spirit of war between old monarchies
and a completely new republic. That is the root of European discord.
<br />
state counsellor: But can’t this hostile spirit be contained by recent memories and stopped by the attitude you adopt?
<br />
first consul: <light-highlight>Palliatives are not remedies.</light-highlight> In our position, I regard any
peace as a brief truce and my ten-year appointment as destined to wage
war virtually uninterrupted. My successors will do what they can. (This was
before the lifetime Consulate.) Besides, don’t think that I want to break
the peace; no, I will certainly not play the role of aggressor. I have too much
interest in leaving the initiative to the foreigners. I know them well: they
will be the first to take up arms again or to furnish me with just grounds for
taking them up again. I will be ready for any eventuality.
<br />
state counsellor: So, citizen consul, what I feared a few moments ago is
precisely what you are hoping for.
<br />
first consul: I am waiting; and my principle is that war is preferable to an
ephemeral peace. We shall see what the latter will turn out to be. At this
moment, it is a great prize. It seals recognition of my government by the
one that resisted it longest: that is the most important thing. As for the
rest—that’s to say, the future—depending on circumstances.

<p>At first glance, I was initially skeptical of structuring fragments of Napoleon’s writings into a framework much like Clausewitz’s <em>Vom Kriege</em>. But as I read, I found the author’s views quite insightful, as he guides us through different aspects of the theory and practice of war as found in Napoleon’s writings and speeches - a “continuation of political intercourse, with the addition of other means.” The endnotes are extremely helpful and allow one to reference the actual source of many phrases attributed to him.</p>

<p>Some time ago, I encountered a snippet of Napoleon’s political philosophy in a note or preface of a textbook, which made the claim that Napoleon’s “boundless ego and lack of ethical principles are reflected in the statements below.” It then proceeded to quote something to the effect of, “My policy is to govern men the way the great majority wants to be governed. This, I believe, is the only way in which it is possible to acknowledge the sovereignty of the people… Don’t talk to me of goodness, of abstract justice, of natural law. Necessity is the highest law; public welfare is the highest justice.”</p>

<p>Now, growing up in a republic, I couldn’t bring myself around that assertion. Democracy naturally approximates to the “way the great majority wants to be governed”, in one way or another; the Federalist Papers talk at length about human nature and how this may be achieved. Politics is rarely initiated from abstract principles - it manifests through policy objectives, stemming from the conflicting tensions of different groups, each wanting to strengthen themselves without upsetting the delicate balance - for that would cause them to lose all. Napoleon governed not as an abstract philosopher - but as one with a firm grasp on reality.</p>

You will see that peace, however advantageous I am able to make it, will be
deemed disadvantageous by the same persons who demand it so insistently,
because they are idiots and ignoramuses who are incapable of knowing
anything about it. It is quite ridiculous of them never to stop repeating that
people want peace, as if peace meant something: what matters are the
conditions.

<quote>
The Police Minister, in his policing notes (with which in general I am very
satisfied, because of the details they contain and the frequent proof of his zeal
I detect in them), seems to seek to render me pacific. This cannot have any
result, and is wounding to me, because it assumes that I am not pacific.
I want peace, but not a peace that has me taking up arms again three months later and which is dishonorable.
<br /><br />

It is not by crying 'Peace!' that one obtains it.

<p>I note one statement for its perspicuity: <em>Palliatives are not remedies.</em> This is the critical concept of governance. Consider Cicero’s final exhortation in his First Catiline Oration:</p>

<quote>
We have now for a long time, O conscript fathers, lived among these dangers and machinations of conspiracy; but somehow or other, the ripeness of all wickedness, and of this long-standing madness and audacity, has come to a head at the time of my consulship. But if this man alone is removed from this piratical crew, we may appear, perhaps, for a short time relieved from fear and anxiety, but the danger will settle down and lie hid in the veins and bowels of the republic. As it often happens that men afflicted with a severe disease, when they are tortured with heat and fever, if they drink cold water, seem at first to be relieved, but afterward suffer more and more severely; so this disease which is in the republic, if relieved by the punishment of this man, will only get worse and worse, as the rest will be still alive.
<br /><br />
Wherefore, O conscript fathers, let the worthless be gone,—let them separate themselves from the good,—let them collect in one place,—let them, as I have often said before, be separated from us by a wall; let them cease to plot against the consul in his own house,—to surround the tribunal of the city pretor,—to besiege the senate-house with swords,—to prepare brands and torches to burn the city; let it, in short, be written on the brow of every citizen, what his sentiments are about the republic.
<br /><br />

<p>I wish to wrap up with another great Roman work: Caesar’s Commentaries. Napoleon mastered military science with the civil qualities suitable for governance; Cicero established his legacy with his political rhetoric; Caesar is remembered for both.</p>

<p>As it is difficult to extract oneself from political musings in these days, I found myself more attuned to the political implications of his writings - that is, his views on diplomacy and internal governance. And in it, we find the very thing most to be desired in war and peace: to find the root of political power.</p>

<p>Chapter 17:</p>
<quote>
Tum demum Liscus oratione Caesaris adductus quod antea tacuerat proponit: 
esse non nullos, quorum auctoritas apud plebem plurimum valeat, 
qui privatim plus possint quam ipsi magistratus.
<br /><br />
Then at length Liscus, moved by Caesar's speech, discloses what he had hitherto kept secret: - that there are some whose influences with the people is very great, who, though private men, have more power than the magistrates themselves: that these by seditions and violent language are deterring the populace from contributing the corn which they ought to supply; [by telling them] that, if they can not any longer retain the supremacy of Gaul, it were better to submit to the government of Gauls than of Romans, nor ought they to doubt that, if the Romans should overpower the Helvetii, they would wrest their freedom from the Aedui together with the remainder of Gaul. By these very men, are our plans and whatever is done in the camp, disclosed to the enemy; that they could not be restrained by him: nay more, he was well aware, that though compelled by necessity, he had disclosed the matter to Caesar, at how great a risk he had done it; and for that reason, he had been silent as long as he could."

<p>This is, I believe, the apex of Book 1 of the Gallic Wars.</p>
