<p>To Jerod:</p>

<p>What role have I ended up in? State Department? Data Science? Quant Research? I don’t know at the moment. But I do know that wherever I end up, I’ll need to write. A lot.</p>

<p>Why do I write?</p>

<ul>
  <li>To build connections with people</li>
  <li>To inform an audience on a topic</li>
  <li>To persuade an audience to do something</li>
  <li>To learn from the audience.</li>
  <li>To persuade someone that you are a valuable addition to their company or friend circle</li>
</ul>

<p>And so on.</p>

<p>All of these go back to the first point: building connections with people. Nearly every interaction with another human involves some form of persuasion. No matter what you’re doing in life, you’ll spend a great deal of time trying to persuade people to do one thing or another.</p>

<p>There are thousands of ways to begin an essay, speech, or organic conversation with someone you bumped into. But there are certain guidelines to follow in order to do it right.</p>

<p>Writing is a learnable skill. A bad essay, speech or conversation will either complain or talk about boring experiences. But even something as boring as <a href="http://jerodsun.xyz/explainer">string search algorithms</a> can be presented in an interesting way. <em>That</em> is the essence of what I’ve learned in Prof Lipscomb’s Writing class in my first semester at Georgetown.</p>

<p>In the first day of class, we read the text of a Colorado ballot measure. You may not remember the exact text on that ballot measure, but you do remember that it was <em>not</em> fun to read. Without sounding too pretentious, I consider myself decently well-versed in politics and law. Certainly competent enough to summarize SCOTUS opinions. But SCOTUS opinions were easier to read than that ballot measure. This is a valuable lesson on knowing your audience - this is how <em>not</em> to write to any kind of audience.</p>

<p>You should remember three readings from this class: Joseph Williams’ <em>Style</em>, Graff and Birkenstein’s <em>They Say, I Say</em>, and Jakob Nielsen’s <em>How People Read on the Web The Eyetracking Evidence</em>.</p>

<p>From these, I learned several valuable lessons. Let me highlight one that I disliked and even wrote a blog post complaining about. Templates. But in writing this letter and constructing this portfolio, I’ve come to realize how much I’ve been unconsciously relying on templates. Better to do it consciously from now on.</p>

<h3 id="templates">Templates</h3>

<p>Many accomplished writers rely on certain patterns and templates in order to convey their ideas. Am I drafting press releases for the State Department, or putting together a PowerPoint for [insert bulge bracket bank]? I’ll be recycling my old work. A repertoire of templates is like the scales and arpeggios for violin practice - do it and save hours of grunt work.</p>

<p>Templates are critical for on-the-fly writing and conversation. In politics and international relations, the most important thing is to establish good relationships. Make it abundantly clear that you <em>listen to what others say</em>. Having listened to others, use templates to show them that you’ve listened. While maintaining the right to disagree, do it in a way that is constructive.</p>

<p>“X is right that __________, but she seems on more dubious ground when she claims that __________.”</p>

<p>“I do support X’s position that __________, but I find Y’s argument about __________ and Z’s research on __________ to be equally persuasive.”</p>

<p>Of course, there are situations where you will need to be obstinate. But most of the time, there’s a way to do it and still include the original author’s premises. That’s where these templates come in useful. Graff and Birkenstein present several other ways to respond. Take a moment and look at those.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>

<p>Ask questions. I don’t mean rhetorical questions - ask straightforward questions that you might have an answer to. This has several advantages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stimulate a different part of the audience’s brain.</li>
  <li>Give the audience a direction into where you’re going.</li>
  <li>Remind <em>yourself</em> what you are talking about.</li>
</ul>

<p>In formal writing, the occasional question helps readers follow your argument. In informal writing, keep asking questions and look for something that you have in common with the audience. Questions connect you with your reader, just as they do in conversation. All of my writing samples in this portfolio contain a question.</p>

<h3 id="looking-back-moving-forward">Looking back, moving forward</h3>

<p>In my <a href="http://jerodsun.xyz/writingtool">writing tool</a> I use a mnemonic to keep these and other concepts in mind. Use the writing tool!</p>

<p>My <a href="/writ_files/roth_paper_portfolio.pdf">proseminar essay</a> should remind me of my writing style before this writing class. This essay was written early in the semester - when I was developing a grasp of these concepts. Here’s one concept I learned that will be useful for this essay: logical flow between paragraphs. Do this by adding cohesive glue between sentences.</p>

<p>But the more important part is the <em>editing phase</em>. Indeed, my style has not changed as much as matured. The real personal developments came from getting my essays back and <em>editing</em> them. In my writing tool, I have a section - PEPPER - for editing. I can look over this essay now and identify the places where I can add cohesive glue - and it should be the same places whenever I reread this.</p>

<p><em>Editing</em> is the most important part of writing, because while you may have read it many times, your reader is approaching it the first time. Shock and awe your reader.</p>

<p>According to Nielsen, I should be reading this with an F pattern. Hope you’re still reading, because this last part is the most important.</p>

<h3 id="passion-whatever-youre-writing-on-find-a-way-to-turn-it-into-something-youre-passionate-about">Passion. <strong>Whatever you’re writing on, find a way to turn it into something you’re passionate about.</strong></h3>

<p>When you look at these in the future, think of how far you’ve gone and how these formed the foundation for a new paradigm in writing.</p>

<h2 id="refer-to-these-works">Refer to these works</h2>

<p><a href="/writ_files/roth_paper_portfolio.pdf">My first proseminar essay, on Philip Roth</a>.</p>

<p>My <a href="http://jerodsun.xyz/writingtool">writing tool</a> presents writing and editing advice to keep in mind for current me and future me.</p>

<p>Writing a well-crafted proposal, presentation or pitch? Review your <a href="/writ_files/earthquake_report_portfolio.pdf">proposal to improve the California Seismic Safety Commission’s “What to do After an Earthquake”</a> page.</p>

<p>My <a href="/writ_files/revised_oped.pdf">Op-ed</a> is a persuasive argument for a ballot measure in California’s 2020 election.</p>

<p>Preparing something for an academic journal? Review how you wrote in the <a href="/writ_files/lit_review.pdf">Literature Review</a>.</p>

<p>Thinking of how to explain a concept to a non-academic audience? Take a look at <a href="http://jerodsun.xyz/explainer">the Explainer</a> you wrote in Prof Lipscomb’s class.</p>

<p>For a coffee break, take a look at <a href="http://jerodsun.xyz/writing">this webpage</a> designed for other students explaining important principles in Joseph William’s <em>Style</em>.</p>

<p>For applying these principles in preparing a technical report, see the <a href="http://jerodsun.xyz/addressmatching">address exploration for CSET</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for an awesome semester, Prof Lipscomb!</p>
